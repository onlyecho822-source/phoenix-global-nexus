## 5. OPTIMAL REPOSITORY ARCHITECTURE

**Total Recommended Repositories:** 42 (31 existing + 11 new)

**Harmonic Distribution:**
- TIER 0 (NEXUS): 4 repos (10%)
- TIER 1 (RESEARCH): 8 repos (19%)
- TIER 2 (ENGINES): 5 repos (12%)
- TIER 3 (APPS): 5 repos (12%)
- TIER 4 (SCHOOL): 5 repos (12%)
- TIER 5 (BOOKS): 5 repos (12%)
