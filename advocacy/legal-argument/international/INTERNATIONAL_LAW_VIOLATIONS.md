# LEGAL ANALYSIS: INTERNATIONAL LAW VIOLATIONS

This section details the specific violations of international law arising from the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela and the threats against Greenland/Denmark in January 2026.

## 4.1 UN Charter Article 2(4): Prohibition on the Threat or Use of Force

> "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations."
> — UN Charter, Article 2(4)

**Finding:** The U.S. military operation in Venezuela and the threats of force against Greenland/Denmark constitute clear violations of Article 2(4), a cornerstone of the post-World War II international legal order.

### Application to Venezuela Intervention

**Act of Aggression:** The January 3, 2026 military operation—involving attacks on sites in Caracas and the capture of the sitting head of state, President Nicolás Maduro—is a textbook example of the use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of a sovereign state. This constitutes an act of aggression under international law.

**Invalid Self-Defense Claim:** The administration's justification of "self-defense" under **UN Charter Article 51** is legally untenable. Article 51 permits the use of force only in response to an "armed attack." International legal scholars and bodies have consistently held that criminal activities, including drug trafficking, do not constitute an "armed attack" that triggers the right to unilateral military self-defense. The appropriate response to transnational crime is law enforcement cooperation, not military invasion.

### Application to Greenland/NATO Threats

**Threat of Force:** Article 2(4) prohibits not only the *use* of force but also the *threat* of force. The administration's actions against Denmark, a NATO ally, meet this threshold:

- **Explicit Refusal to Rule Out Force:** When repeatedly asked if he would use military force to seize Greenland, the President's response of "No comment. You'll find out" is a clear, implicit threat.
- **Coercive Rhetoric:** Senior administration officials, such as Stephen Miller, have publicly asserted a right to take territory by force, citing "iron laws" of strength. This rhetoric, directed at a specific territorial dispute, constitutes a threat.
- **Economic Coercion:** The threat of "100%" tariffs against eight European NATO allies for their opposition to the Greenland plan is a form of economic coercion designed to achieve a political-military objective, further violating the spirit of the UN Charter.

## 4.2 Violation of Sovereign Immunity

**Finding:** The capture and prosecution of a sitting head of state in a foreign national court is a flagrant violation of the principle of sovereign immunity.

**Legal Standard:** Under customary international law, a sitting head of state, head of government, and foreign minister enjoy absolute immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of foreign national courts (*ratione personae*). This immunity is a procedural bar to prosecution, regardless of the gravity of the underlying alleged crime.

**Application:** The abduction of President Nicolás Maduro and his subsequent transport to the United States to face drug trafficking charges in a U.S. federal court is a direct breach of this fundamental principle of international law. The charges themselves do not negate the immunity that attaches to his official status as a sitting head of state.

## 4.3 War Crimes: Perfidy and Killing of Survivors

**Finding:** The September 2, 2025, precursor operation in Venezuela involved actions that likely constitute war crimes under the Geneva Conventions and the U.S. Law of War Manual.

**Legal Standard:** The laws of armed conflict (LOAC) apply during international and non-international armed conflicts. While the administration's "war on cartels" is a legally dubious framework, if U.S. forces operate under the assumption of an armed conflict, they are bound by its rules.

### Violation A: Perfidy

**Definition:** Perfidy is a war crime that involves feigning civilian, non-combatant, or other protected status to gain a military advantage before an attack. It is explicitly prohibited by **Article 37 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions** and is considered a grave breach.

**Application:** Reports indicate the U.S. aircraft that conducted the September 2, 2025, attack was disguised as a civilian plane. If true, this act of feigning civilian status to deceive the target before the attack constitutes perfidy.

### Violation B: Attacking Persons *Hors de Combat*

**Definition:** Individuals who are shipwrecked or are otherwise out of combat are protected persons under LOAC and may not be attacked.

**Application:** The reported "double-tap" strike, which targeted and killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of the boat, is a direct violation of this core principle. These individuals were *hors de combat* and attacking them constitutes a war crime.

## 4.4 Violation of the NATO Treaty

**Finding:** The threats against Greenland/Denmark represent a fundamental breach of the spirit and purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty.

**Legal Standard:** The NATO Treaty is a collective defense alliance built on the principle of mutual trust and security. **Article 5** states that an attack on one member is an attack on all.

**Application:** By publicly threatening a NATO ally and refusing to rule out the use of force, the administration has created an unprecedented crisis within the alliance. Denmark's response—listing the U.S. as a national security threat and vowing to invoke Article 5 if attacked—demonstrates the severity of the breach. This action undermines the very foundation of the alliance, transforming a collective defense pact into a source of potential conflict among its members.
