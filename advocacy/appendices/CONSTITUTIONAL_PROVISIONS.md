## U.S. Constitution: Bill of Rights

### First Amendment

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

**Relevance:** Protects the rights of citizens to protest, observe, and document federal enforcement actions. Violated by the use of force against peaceful protesters and the intimidation of observers.

---

### Fourth Amendment

> The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

**Relevance:** Protects against warrantless home entries and suspicionless stops. The core of the domestic constitutional violations documented in this report.

---

### Fifth Amendment (Due Process Clause)

> No person shall be... deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law...

**Relevance:** Applies the Equal Protection principles of the 14th Amendment to the federal government. Violated by discriminatory enforcement actions.

---

### Tenth Amendment

> The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.

**Relevance:** The basis for the anti-commandeering doctrine, which prohibits the federal government from compelling states to implement federal programs. Violated by the effective commandeering of local police resources.

---

### Fourteenth Amendment, Section 1 (Equal Protection and Due Process)

> ...nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

**Relevance:** Prohibits discriminatory enforcement based on race or ethnicity. Violated by the alleged pattern of racial profiling.

---

## U.S. Constitution: Separation of Powers

### Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 (War Powers)

> The Congress shall have Power... To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water;

**Relevance:** Vests the power to initiate war in Congress, not the President. Violated by the unauthorized military intervention in Venezuela.

---

### Article II, Section 4 (Impeachment Clause)

> The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.

**Relevance:** The constitutional remedy for presidential abuse of power. The actions documented in this report may constitute "high Crimes and Misdemeanors."

---

### Article III, Section 3 (Treason)

> Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.

**Relevance:** Defines treason narrowly. The actions documented in this report, while potentially constituting "high Crimes," do not meet this specific constitutional definition of treason.

---

## U.S. Constitution: 25th Amendment (Presidential Succession and Disability)

### Section 4

> Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President...

**Relevance:** Provides a mechanism for addressing presidential "inability" to discharge duties. This is a remedy for medical or psychological incapacity, not for political or legal misconduct. The appropriate remedy for the abuses documented in this report is Congressional oversight and the impeachment power, not the 25th Amendment.
