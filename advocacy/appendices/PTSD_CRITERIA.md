# APPENDIX E: PTSD DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA (DSM-5-TR)

**Source:** American Psychiatric Association. (2022). *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR)*. American Psychiatric Publishing.

**Purpose:** To provide the authoritative clinical standard for PTSD diagnosis, demonstrating how current conditions meet the threshold for traumatic exposure.

## DSM-5-TR Diagnostic Criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

**Note:** The following criteria apply to adults, adolescents, and children older than 6 years.

---

### Criterion A: Exposure to Trauma (Stressor)

**Requirement:** Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence in one (or more) of the following ways:

| Pathway | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| **A1. Direct Exposure** | Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s). |
| **A2. Witnessing** | Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others. |
| **A3. Learning** | Learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a close family member or close friend. In cases of actual or threatened death of a family member or friend, the event(s) must have been violent or accidental. |
| **A4. Repeated Exposure** | Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic event(s) (e.g., first responders collecting human remains; police officers repeatedly exposed to details of child abuse). *Note: Criterion A4 does not apply to exposure through electronic media, television, movies, or pictures, unless this exposure is work-related.* |

---

### Criterion B: Intrusion Symptoms (1 or more required)

Presence of one (or more) of the following intrusion symptoms associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning after the traumatic event(s) occurred:

1Jean.  Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event(s).
2.  Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of the dream are related to the traumatic event(s).
3.  Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) were recurring.
4.  Intense or prolonged psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s).
5.  Marked physiological reactions to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s).

---

### Criterion C: Avoidance (1 or more required)

Persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by one or both of the following:

1.  Avoidance of or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).
2.  Avoidance of or efforts to avoid external reminders (people, places, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).

---

### Criterion D: Negative Alterations in Cognitions and Mood (2 or more required)

Negative alterations in cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by two (or more) of the following:

1.  Inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event(s) (typically due to dissociative amnesia and not to other factors such as head injury, alcohol, or drugs).
2.  Persistent and exaggerated negative beliefs or expectations about oneself, others, or the world.
3.  Persistent, distorted cognitions about the cause or consequences of the traumatic event(s) that lead the individual to blame himself/herself or others.
4.  Persistent negative emotional state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, or shame).
5.  Markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities.
6.  Feelings of detachment or estrangement from others.
7.  Persistent inability to experience positive emotions.

---

### Criterion E: Alterations in Arousal and Reactivity (2 or more required)

Marked alterations in arousal and reactivity associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by two (or more) of the following:

1.  Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation) typically expressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects.
2.  Reckless or self-destructive behavior.
3.  Hypervigilance.
4.  Exaggerated startle response.
5.  Problems with concentration.
6.  Sleep disturbance.

---

### Criterion F: Duration

Duration of the disturbance (Criteria B, C, D, and E) is more than 1 month.

---

### Criterion G: Functional Significance

The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

---

### Criterion H: Exclusion

The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., medication, alcohol) or another medical condition.

---

## Application to Current Conditions

The environment created by "Operation Metro Surge" and the administration's broader actions systematically satisfies **Criterion A** for large segments of the population. The table below maps current conditions to the specific pathways of traumatic exposure.

| Criterion A Pathway | Current Condition | Assessment |
|:--------------------|:------------------|:-----------|
| **A1. Direct Exposure** | Civilians in residential areas facing armed federal agents during raids; individuals being stopped and detained at gunpoint. | **MET** |
| **A2. Witnessing** | Public, eyewitness viewing of the fatal shooting of Renée Good; residents witnessing violent arrests and forced entries in their neighborhoods. | **MET** |
| **A3. Learning** | Community members learning of the violent detention or harm of neighbors, friends, and family members through local news and social networks. | **MET** |
| **A4. Repeated Exposure** | First responders and journalists with continuous, work-related exposure to aversive details of violent encounters. | **MET** |

**Conclusion:** The conditions created by these federal actions meet the clinical threshold for traumatic exposure under DSM-5-TR Criterion A. This is not a political claim; it is a clinical reality.
