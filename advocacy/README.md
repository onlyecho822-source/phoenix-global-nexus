## CORE THESIS

A unified doctrine of **unlimited executive power** is being applied domestically and internationally, systematically bypassing constitutional checks, congressional authority, international law, and alliance obligations. This pattern has created conditions meeting the clinical threshold for **mass psychological trauma (PTSD)** under established military and civilian standards.

When the constitutional mechanisms designed to check this power (impeachment, judicial review) have themselves been compromised, the ultimate check on government rests with **the people**. This campaign provides the legal framework and practical tools for citizens to exercise that power.
