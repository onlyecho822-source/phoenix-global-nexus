## Core Message

**Our government is violating the Constitution, breaking international law, and traumatizing its own people. This is a constitutional and public health crisis that transcends politics. We demand accountability, a return to the rule of law, and a national commitment to healing the trauma our leaders have inflicted.**

## Key Talking Points

### On Constitutional Violations at Home ("Operation Metro Surge")

-   "The Fourth Amendment is not a suggestion. Federal agents cannot force their way into your home without a warrant signed by a judge. What happened in Minneapolis is a direct assault on the rights of every American."
-   "Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy. When federal agents use tear gas and pepper balls on citizens for speaking out, they are attacking the First Amendment."
-   "This isn't about immigration. This is about a dangerous federal overreach. They came for our neighbors in Minneapolis today; they could come for you tomorrow."

### On Unlawful Wars and Threats Abroad (Venezuela & Greenland)

-   "The power to declare war belongs to Congress, not the President. The unauthorized military attack on Venezuela is an illegal war that puts our troops at risk and destabilizes the world."
-   "A president who threatens to attack a NATO ally is a threat to our own national security. The NATO alliance has kept the peace for 75 years; we cannot allow it to be destroyed by reckless leadership."
-   "Our service members swear an oath to the Constitution, not to a single person. Forcing them to choose between that oath and an unlawful order is a betrayal of their service and their trust."

### On PTSD and Public Trauma

-   "PTSD isn't just for soldiers in combat. It's a natural response to terror and violence, wherever it happens. When the government becomes the source of that terror, it creates a national public health crisis."
-   "Moral injury is the hidden wound of these crises. We are asking our troops and federal agents to violate their conscience and the law. That is a burden no one should have to carry."
-   "Healing our nation requires more than just political change. It requires a national commitment to mental health and trauma care for everyone affected—civilians, veterans, and service members alike."

## Audience-Specific Messaging

-   **For Veterans and Service Members:** "You swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That oath matters now more than ever. You have a legal and moral duty to refuse unlawful orders. This campaign supports you, and we will fight to ensure you are protected, not punished, for upholding your oath."

-   **For Conservatives and Libertarians:** "This is a fundamental issue of limited government and constitutional checks and balances. If the executive branch can ignore the Fourth Amendment, bypass Congress on war, and use federal force against its own citizens with impunity, then there is no limit to its power."

-   **For Progressives and Civil Rights Advocates:** "This is the culmination of a long-standing pattern of federal overreach and abuse, disproportionately targeting minority communities. We must stand in solidarity with those most affected and fight for a system that truly provides liberty and justice for all."

-   **For Healthcare and Mental Health Professionals:** "We are witnessing a mass trauma event. As professionals, we have a duty to speak out about the public health consequences of these government actions and to advocate for a trauma-informed response at every level of society."
