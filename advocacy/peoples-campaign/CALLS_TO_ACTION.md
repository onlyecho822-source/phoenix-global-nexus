# TAKE ACTION: DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY, HEAL OUR NATION

Your voice is critical. Complacency is not an option. Use these tools to demand action from your elected officials and to support your community.

## 1. CONTACT YOUR REPRESENTATIVES (Federal, State, and Local)

**This is the single most important action you can take.**

Use the links below to find your representatives. Call them. Email them. Tell them you are a constituent and you demand they take action.

-   **[Find Your U.S. Congressional Representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)**
-   **[Find Your U.S. Senators](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm)**

### Sample Script/Email Template:

> **Subject: I Demand an Investigation into Constitutional Violations**
> 
> Dear [Representative/Senator NAME],
> 
> I am a constituent from [YOUR CITY/TOWN], and I am writing to demand that you take immediate action to address the systemic constitutional violations and abuses of power being carried out by the federal executive branch.
> 
> The recent "Operation Metro Surge" in Minneapolis, the unauthorized military intervention in Venezuela, and the threats against our NATO allies are not isolated incidents. They are part of a dangerous pattern that undermines the rule of law, endangers our national security, and is causing widespread psychological trauma to both civilians and our service members.
> 
> I demand that you use your office to:
> 
> 1.  **Publicly condemn these actions.**
> 2.  **Call for immediate, independent Congressional investigations** with subpoena power.
> 3.  **Support legislation** to protect our service members from being forced to follow unlawful orders and to defund these unconstitutional operations.
> 4.  **Demand federal funding** for community-based trauma and mental health services for those affected.
> 
> The Constitution is not optional. My rights are not negotiable. I will be watching your actions on this matter very closely.
> 
> Sincerely,
> 
> [YOUR NAME]
> [YOUR ADDRESS]

## 4. KNOW YOUR RIGHTS

If you encounter federal law enforcement, it is critical to know your rights.

-   **[ACLU: Know Your Rights](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/immigrants-rights/)**
-   **You have the right to remain silent.**
-   **You do not have to consent to a search of yourself or your property.**
-   **If agents are at your door, you do not have to open it unless they have a judicial warrant signed by a judge.** An administrative warrant is not enough.
-   **You have the right to record.** In most public places, you have the right to film law enforcement activity.

**The time for silence is over. The fight for the soul of our nation is now.**
