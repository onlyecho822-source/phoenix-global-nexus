# THE PEOPLE'S REMEDIES: WHAT WE CAN DO WHEN INSTITUTIONS FAIL

**A Practical Guide for Citizens When Congress Won't Act and Courts Won't Check**

---

## THE REALITY WE FACE

The President has been impeached. The Senate did not convict. The Supreme Court has been reshaped by partisan appointments. The normal constitutional checks—impeachment, judicial review—have been tested and have failed to restrain executive overreach.

**This is not the end. This is where the people's power begins.**

The Constitution was written by "We the People." When the institutions we created fail us, we do not lose our power. We must exercise it directly.

## WHAT CAN THE PEOPLE DO?

### 1. SUPPORT YOUR STATE

Your state government is your first line of defense against federal overreach.

**What States Can Do:**
- **Pass Protective Laws:** States like California have passed laws making it a crime for federal agents to conceal their identity from local police. Demand your state do the same.
- **Refuse Cooperation:** States can refuse to use state resources (police, jails, databases) to assist unconstitutional federal operations. This is legal under the anti-commandeering doctrine.
- **Prosecute Crimes:** If federal agents commit crimes in your state (assault, unlawful entry, murder), your state's Attorney General can investigate and prosecute them under state law.

**Your Action:**
- Contact your **State Governor** and **State Attorney General**. Demand they take action to protect your rights.
- Contact your **State Legislators**. Demand they pass laws to resist unconstitutional federal actions.

### 2. EXERCISE YOUR POWER AS A JUROR

If you are ever called to serve on a jury, you hold immense power.

**Jury Nullification:** A jury has the inherent power to acquit a defendant if they believe the law is unjust or is being applied unjustly. This power was used by Northern juries to refuse to convict people who helped enslaved people escape under the Fugitive Slave Act.

**What This Means:**
- If a citizen is prosecuted for resisting an unlawful federal action, a jury can refuse to convict.
- If a federal agent is prosecuted under state law for crimes committed during an unconstitutional operation, a jury can ensure accountability.

**Your Action:**
- Never try to avoid jury duty. It is one of the most direct forms of citizen power.
- Educate yourself on jury nullification. (Note: You cannot be punished for your vote as a juror.)

### 3. USE YOUR ECONOMIC POWER

Money is power. Collectively, the American people have more economic power than any government.

**Boycotts:** Refuse to buy from companies that support, profit from, or enable unconstitutional actions. Research which corporations are providing services to these operations.

**General Strikes:** A coordinated refusal to work is one of the most powerful forms of nonviolent protest. The planned "economic blackout" in Minnesota is an example. If millions of people refuse to work for even one day, the economic impact is undeniable.

**Divestment:** Pressure your university, pension fund, or local government to divest from companies involved in these activities.

**Your Action:**
- Participate in organized boycotts and strikes.
- Move your money to local credit unions and community banks.
- Support businesses that share your values.

### 4. ENGAGE IN NONVIOLENT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE

When legal channels are exhausted, the deliberate, public, and nonviolent refusal to comply with unjust laws or orders is a time-honored tradition in American democracy.

**The Principles of Civil Disobedience (from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.):**
1. **Be Nonviolent:** Violence undermines the moral authority of the movement.
2. **Be Public:** The goal is to dramatize injustice and appeal to the public conscience.
3. **Accept the Consequences:** Willingness to be arrested demonstrates commitment and seriousness.
4. **Target a Specific Injustice:** The action must be clearly connected to the wrong being protested.

**Historical Examples:** The sit-ins at segregated lunch counters, the Freedom Rides, the March on Selma—all were acts of civil disobedience that changed the nation.

**Your Action:**
- Join or organize peaceful protests.
- If you choose to engage in civil disobedience, do so with full knowledge of the potential legal consequences and with the support of a community.
- **Know Your Rights:** Have the number of a legal aid organization written on your arm. Do not resist arrest physically.

### 5. APPEAL TO THE WORLD

When domestic institutions fail, the international community can provide pressure and, in some cases, accountability.

**International Criminal Court (ICC):** The ICC can investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity. While the U.S. is not a member, U.S. officials can be investigated for crimes committed on the territory of member states.

**Universal Jurisdiction:** Some countries (like Germany, Spain, and others) have laws allowing their courts to prosecute serious international crimes no matter where they occurred. Officials who travel abroad may face arrest.

**UN Human Rights Mechanisms:** UN bodies can investigate and publicly condemn human rights violations, creating diplomatic pressure.

**Your Action:**
- Support international human rights organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.
- Contact the embassies of allied nations and urge them to speak out.
- Document everything. Video evidence of abuses can be submitted to international bodies.

### 6. VOTE AND ORGANIZE FOR ELECTIONS

Elections remain the most fundamental check on power. Even when the system is flawed, participation is essential.

**Your Action:**
- **Register to vote.** Help others register.
- **Vote in every election**—federal, state, and local. Local officials (sheriffs, district attorneys, state legislators) have significant power to resist federal overreach.
- **Volunteer** for campaigns and get-out-the-vote efforts.
- **Run for office** yourself, or support candidates who will defend the Constitution.

---

### 7. DEMAND A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION (The Long Game)

Article V of the Constitution allows for a Constitutional Convention to be called if two-thirds of state legislatures demand it. This is the ultimate tool for structural reform.

**Potential Reforms:**
- Term limits for Supreme Court justices.
- Clearer limits on executive power.
- Reforms to the impeachment process.
- Protections for voting rights.

**Your Action:**
- Contact your state legislators and urge them to support a call for a convention focused on specific reforms.
- This is a long-term strategy, but it is the path to fundamental, lasting change.

## A FINAL WORD: THE POWER IS OURS

The institutions of government are tools created by the people. When those tools fail, the people do not become powerless. The people are the source of all power.

**This is not a call for violence.** Violence is the tool of tyrants and only begets more tyranny. This is a call for the organized, disciplined, and relentless exercise of the power that already belongs to you.

**Speak. Assemble. Organize. Vote. Resist. Persist.**

The future of the Republic is in your hands.
