# THE PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN: DEFEND RIGHTS, HEAL TRAUMA

**A Non-Partisan Movement for Constitutional Rights, Accountability, and Public Health**

---

## OUR MISSION

We are a coalition of citizens, veterans, service members, legal experts, and mental health professionals united to address a constitutional and public health crisis. Our government's recent actions—both at home and abroad—have violated fundamental laws, eroded public trust, and created conditions of mass psychological trauma.

This campaign is not about politics. It is about defending the U.S. Constitution, upholding the rule of law, and demanding a government that protects, not traumatizes, its people.

**Our mission is to:**

1.  **EDUCATE** the public on the constitutional violations and the reality of state-sanctioned trauma.
2.  **ADVOCATE** for accountability for those who have violated the law and their oath of office.
3.  **HEAL** our communities by demanding resources for trauma care and mental health support.

## THE CRISIS: A THREE-FRONT ASSAULT ON LAW AND LIBERTY

Our nation is facing a coordinated crisis on three fronts, driven by a doctrine of unlimited executive power.

### 1. WAR ON OUR COMMUNITIES: "Operation Metro Surge"

-   **What Happened:** Thousands of federal agents were deployed in Minneapolis, resulting in warrantless raids on citizens' homes, the killing of a U.S. citizen, and the suppression of peaceful protest.
-   **The Impact:** Communities, particularly minority communities, have been terrorized. Families have been separated. Constitutional rights (1st and 4th Amendments) have been systematically violated.

### 2. UNLAWFUL WARS ABROAD: The Venezuela Intervention

-   **What Happened:** The administration launched an unauthorized military attack on Venezuela, a sovereign nation, capturing its head of state in violation of international law and the U.S. Constitution's requirement for Congressional approval.
-   **The Impact:** This action has destabilized the region, created a precedent for illegal wars, and placed U.S. service members in a legally and morally compromised position.

### 3. THREATS AGAINST ALLIES: The Greenland/NATO Crisis

-   **What Happened:** The administration has publicly threatened a NATO ally, Denmark, refusing to rule out the use of military force to seize the territory of Greenland.
-   **The Impact:** This has shattered trust within our most critical military alliance, endangering our national security and the stability of the international order.

## THE HIDDEN WOUND: PTSD AND COLLECTIVE TRAUMA

These actions are not just legal violations; they are acts of mass psychological violence.

**Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is not just a consequence of overseas combat.** It can be caused by any exposure to actual or threatened death or serious injury. The clinical standards used by the military and the VA are clear:

> When a government uses militarized force against its own citizens, threatens its allies, and launches unlawful wars, it creates a **perfect storm for trauma**.

-   **For Civilians:** Living in a state of constant fear, witnessing violence, and losing trust in the institutions meant to protect you is a recipe for PTSD, anxiety, and depression.
-   **For Service Members & Agents:** Being ordered to violate the Constitution, to conduct illegal raids, or to potentially attack an allied nation creates **moral injury**—a deep, soul-level wound that can lead to devastating psychological consequences.

**This is a public health emergency.**
